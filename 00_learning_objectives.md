Learning objectives:
  - Understand scope and how objects are passed
  - More familiarity with common data structures
  - Problem solving using data structures



















Outline
  - Stack vs Heap
    - call stack/scoping
    - variables on the stack, the things they reference in heap
    - drawing memory diagrams
    - object_id
    - assigning to a variable points it somewhere else
  - Data Structures
    - Arrays
    - Hashes
    - different ways to declare each
    - Nested structures
  - Choosing a data structure to fit a task
    - Markov models
  - If there's time (there probably won't be), additional data structures
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Linked Lists
    - Trees
    - Graphs (nodes and edges)
    - Least recently used cache
